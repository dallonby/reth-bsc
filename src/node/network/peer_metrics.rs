//! Periodic aggregated peer-lifecycle metrics.
//!
//! Subscribes to the reth network's `PeerEvent` stream and emits **one
//! `INFO`-level summary line per window** (default 60 s) with counts of
//! sessions established, sessions closed (broken out by
//! `DisconnectReason`), and current peer count.
//!
//! Purpose — diagnosing the `peers-drop-to-zero-after-sync` drain
//! (reth-bsc #320). Under the old behaviour we had no visibility in
//! production into WHY peers were disconnecting; rep-penalty code paths,
//! protocol-breach disconnects, and ordinary ping timeouts all looked the
//! same from the outside. This collector turns it into a single
//! low-frequency line that tells you the shape of the drain:
//!
//!   INFO bsc::peer_metrics window=60s peers=12 opened=3 closed=15
//!        closed_by=disconnect_requested:8,too_many_peers:4,ping_timeout:3
//!
//! which is digestible to a human AND easy to grep / build Grafana
//! panels off later.
//!
//! Design choices:
//!   * aggregation window, not per-event logging — per-peer churn can be
//!     many per second in a healthy network; logging every one would
//!     drown the rest of the node output.
//!   * INFO level, not DEBUG — you want this visible by default in a
//!     running prod node, without having to bump filters.
//!   * per-`DisconnectReason` bucketing — drain-to-zero looks the same as
//!     healthy churn if you only count events; the reason distribution
//!     is what tells you whether something's wrong.
//!   * idle windows are silent — if no peer events happened, no log line
//!     is emitted. Keeps the feed clean during steady-state operation.
